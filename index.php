			<p class="text-justify">Blood is universally recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. Donate Blood Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.

				<p class="text-justify">Improving healthcare for the underprivileged has been the focus for many doctors. Most of us live in urban India, where the healthcare facilities are relatively better (you would know if you ever visit a village or rural area, where one has to travel miles to meet a doctor). There are plenty of doctors, nurses and assisting medical staff. Private hospitals charge more than the government hospitals, but the former also provide us with timely, best quality healthcare. </p>

			A Doctor is a person who helps to keep human health in healthy condition. Doctors help patients to get relief from their pain. Doctors play a very essential role in human life. We can say Doctors are the incarnation of the god. In India, we celebrate National Doctorâ€™s Day on July of 1st to thank physicians and doctors for their dedicated services to patients.
